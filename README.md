### **Notes:**
- **Material**: All materials that come into contact with powder (screw feeder, hopper, etc.) should be **food-grade** and corrosion-resistant, such as **stainless steel** (typically 304 or 316 grade).
- **Customization**: Some components like the frame, screw feeder, and hopper may require custom fabrication based on the specific design and size of your machine.
- **Motor Specifications**: The motor size and type depend on the required torque and speed, which will be determined during the design phase.
